## Contributing
#### Foreword
I plan to have ways to contribute by adding character icons, ships, custom blocks/actions, and custom maps. At the moment, however, none of this has been implemented, so the only way to contribute is to build onto the existing source code.

#### Contributing to the gameplay engine
To contribute to the gameplay engine, you must first install of the project's dependencies. Namely,
- Rojo
- Wally
- Moonwave

*todo: document full installation process*

Now you should be able to either build onto the existing gameplay engine.

## Roadmaps
*todo: move roadmaps to issues after first open-source release*
